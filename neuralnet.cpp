*
*              Neural Net -- A computational model of a neural network
*
* Purpose: Before building a purely analog circuit with the BIAS project, we
*          decided to first develop a computational model of how we expect the
*          circuit to work in a very algorithmic way. 
*
*   Notes: Even though this logic will later be used by the primary BIAS code, 
*          very little analog logic was used in the following script. Rather, 
*          this script was meant to strengthen our own understanding of our 
*          neural system.
*
*          Please let me know if you need any further information!
